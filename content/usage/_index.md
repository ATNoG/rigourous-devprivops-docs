Here we describe the PrivGuide's commands.

## Local Docker Container

To run the tool locally through its docker container, we can use bind mounts when starting the container.

```sh
docker run -d --name privguide -v "<host directory>:/<container directory>/:ro" privguide
```

PrivGuide can then be executed through `docker exec`:

```sh
docker exec privguide privguide test user pass 127.0.0.1 3030 tmp --local-dir <container direcotry>
```
