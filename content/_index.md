# DevPrivOps

This tool assists in architecture design by validating the architecture against a set of rules.

The architecture is described by various **YAML files**, that might be associated with **JSON schemas**, and validated with **SparQL queries**.

Users can specify their own schemas and map them to any actual description files.

The queries, schemas and descriptions can be given by any authority, company or even be provided by the user.

There is also a built-in test system for the queries, wherein a user provides a set of scenarios (test system descriptions) and specifies the expected output of the queries to test.
